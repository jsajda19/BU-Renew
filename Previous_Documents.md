# Previous Documents
Our previous documents include our prototype test plans, reports, and our User's manual. Our User's manual is the final deliverables package we used for the competition.
The files were too large to include in the Github, so we have the link here. https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1k5WRJ-NMOoxzs2-gkhgr5KBJ6MaNOTSK?usp=sharing
Also in this google drive link is our 15 minute interval data which was also too big to be added to the github.
