# BU-Renew

# Summary
This project was developed as part of the U.S. Department of Energyâ€™s Solar District Cup competition. The goal: to design a solar-plus-storage solution for a defined district or campus that maximizes energy offset at the lowest cost, while balancing aesthetic, infrastructure, and community considerations.

Future teams will function as renewable energy system developers, creating a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), solar lease, and/or cash purchase proposal using real load, utility rate, and site data. The competition fosters collaboration across disciplines like electrical and mechanical engineering, urban planning, construction management, and finance.

It also has the 15 minute interval load data. There is also a folder called 'Data Analysis' which has all of python files used in the data analysis. They are described in detail in the README_SOFTWARE.md file.
