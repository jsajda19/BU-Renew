# BU-Renew

# Summary
The College of New Jersey is seeking to contribute toward environmental decarbonization, and it wants to have those efforts be recognized by its students, the local Township of Ewing, and beyond. TCNJ has been considering the installation of solar arrays and battery storage to achieve this goal, and BU Renew is proposing a comprehensive plan to satisfy those demands. Our proposed solution includes carefully considered rooftop mounted solar array sites as well as an aesthetically appealing solar SmartFlower. The proposed solar arrays will spark interest in renewable energy from students while producing over 1.4 gigawatts-hours of energy annually. This project will also create jobs for solar installation technicians in the local community for its duration to help bolster the economy. Even options such as EV charging become more practical for the college upon installation of the solar panels. BU Renew has ensured that the proposed solar arrays comply with all local, state, and federal construction regulations so that TCNJ’s community can count on the systems being safe and reliable. The project was also designed to be as sustainable as possible for a reasonable price. BU Renew’s proposal will help TCNJ lead the way in the renewable energy future.

# Conclusion
The proposed solar energy system not only aligns with TCNJ’s goal of carbon neutrality by 2040, it also provides a realistic and feasible means of supplying the campus with electricity at a more cost-effective rate. Consisting of mostly rooftop solar systems, our solution aligns with local regulations and requirements while also providing an aesthetic option in the form of the SmartFlower. By carefully considering TCNJ’s energy needs, while keeping important constraints in mind, our system has the potential to improve campus energy independence and resiliency while encouraging student engagement and support. In fact, TCNJ could save up to $3,000,000 in energy costs while producing 1.45 GWh annually. 

     The rooftop arrays, strategically located on 11 different buildings throughout TCNJ’s campus, were selected based on roof size and condition, shading levels, and electric demand to produce the most efficient solar system. Being that ground-mounted systems are not permitted in TCNJ’s zone, the majority of our expected energy production is sourced from the rooftop arrays. While being much smaller in size and production, the SmartFlower array is suggested as a means of improving aesthetics and social impact on campus. 

     By providing an accurate financial analysis of our system, TCNJ can view their options for covering the proposed system costs in the most efficient manner they see fit, with the utilization of a third party investor and/or other renewable energy incentives and credits.





# GitHub Structure

This GitHub has a file called Prvious_Documents.md. In this document is a google drive link with our final deliverables package, and our test plans and reports. It also has the 15 minute interval load data. There is also a folder called 'Data Analysis' which has all of python files used in the data analysis. They are described in detail in the README_SOFTWARE.md file.
